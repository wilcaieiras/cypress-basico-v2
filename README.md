# cypress-basico-v2

Sample project for the basic course of the Talking About Testing  online school.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

I used versions 'v16.13.2' and '8.3.2' of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same of later versions.

## Installation

Run 'npm install' (or 'npm i' for a short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

You can tun the tests simulating a desktop or mobile viewport.

## Desktop

Run 'npm_test' (or 'npm t' for the short version) to run the test in headless mode on a Desktop viewport

Or, run npm run cy:open to open Cypress in interactive mode on a desktop.

## Mobile

Run 'npm_test:mobile' (or 'npm t' for the short version) to run the test in headless mode on a mobile viewport.

Or, run npm run cy:open:mobile to open Cypress in interactive mode on a mobile viewport.
